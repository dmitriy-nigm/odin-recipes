        <li>6 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>

        <li>¼ cup fresh green peas</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally
            until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. 
            Drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat,
            turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. 
            Remove bacon with a slotted spoon, leaving drippings in pan; 
            set bacon aside.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir garlic in the remaining bacon grease over medium heat. 
            Add milk, cream cheese, and butter to skillet; stir until smooth. 
            Stir Parmesan cheese, peas, ham, and bacon into cream cheese mixture;
            cook until peas are heated through, about 5 minutes more. 
            Mix pasta into sauce to serve.</li>
    </ol>
